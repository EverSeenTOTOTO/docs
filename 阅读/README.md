* 44年前我们就把人类送上月球了，但现在我们仍然无法在CSS中实现垂直居中。
* 所谓monad，不过是自函子范畴上的幺半群罢了。
* 加法之下的非负整数形成的是可交换幺半群而不是一个合适的阿贝尔群。（故3-5=0）
* 你有一个难题，你想到了用正则表达式来解决。现在，你有两个难题了。
* 不要关闭电灯开关，因为它同样作用于电梯。（**S**OLID ）
* 任何C或Fortran程序复杂到一定程度之后，都会包含一个临时开发的、只有一半功能的、不完全符合规格的、到处都是bug的、运行速度很慢的Common Lisp实现。
* All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.
* 当开始编写软件时，其实我们所知甚少。
* There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the one nobody uses.
* The hardest problem in computer science is naming.
* Many programmers were dragged through a compilers class in college and took away from it nothing but PTSD triggered by the sight of a book with a dragon on the cover or the words “lex” and “yacc”.（很多开发者毫无准备地被拖入大学中的编译课程，然后带着除了被一本封面上画着龙的书或`lex`、`yacc`这样的名词所引起的严重的PTSD以外什么也没有便离开了。）
* There’s a slightly humorous stereotype about computational complexity that says what we often end up doing is taking a problem that is solved a lot of the time in practice and proving that it’s actually very difficult.（关于计算复杂度的幽默：我们经常拿起一个现实中已经被解决了无数次的问题然后证明它真得很复杂。）
* Keep me alive. （Vim作者）
* The fastest code is the code you don't execute.
* In academia, everyone is smart and some of them are nice. In the private sector, everyone is nice and some of them are smart.
* Relaxing a requirement should be a compatible change. Strengthening a promise should be a compatible change.
* Many programmers are afraid to share work they’ve only just started because it means peers will see their mistakes and know the author of the code is not a genius. （Software Engineering at Google）
* 地图的最大部分一定是未知领域。（扎克伯格）
* Talk is not cheap. Talk can be powerful.（王垠：很多人被“成果”或者代码所蒙蔽，而忽略了那些能够看透问题，用简单的几句话指出正确方向的人。）
* The classroom is a wonderful, if artificial, place: Your professor gets paid to pay attention to your ideas, and your classmates are paying to pay attention to your ideas. Never again in your life will you have such a captive audience. Soon after, you learn that most of the world doesn’t necessarily care about what you think.
* Lisp programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.
* To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
* 学术研究的意义不在发现和批评荒谬，而在发掘和解释荒谬背后的逻辑。
* A PhD knows more and more about less and less until he knows everything about nothing.
* Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
* 软件变慢的速度永远快过硬件变快的速度。
* “好的，不过它会不会在微波炉上运行呢？”（Lua作者）
* Web3.0不是在一块空白之地上建立空中楼阁，它致力于解决人类社会发展中的深层次问题。
* 该文读起来晦涩难懂，不建议阅读。（《OSTEP》书中关于《The Single UNIX Specification, Version 3》的吐嘈）
* Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.（Minecraft结束语）
* Great minds discuss semantics, average minds discuss syntax and small minds discuss syntax of comments.
* If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.
